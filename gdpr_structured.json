The proper functioning of the internal mark et requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restr icted or prohibit ed for reasons connecte d with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derog ation for organisations with fewer than 250 emplo yees with regar d to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their super visor y author ities, are encourag ed to take account of the specifi c needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterpr ises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC"
